<h1>Installation and System Requirements</h1>

<h2>Installing <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> for personal use.</h2>

<p>
If your version of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> has <i>not</i> been bought through <b>Steam</b>, you will need to run the program <tt>GMStudio-Installer.exe</tt> and follow the on-screen instructions to 
install. You are given the option to install the program anywhere you like but it is recommended that you follow the default suggestions given. Once installation is completed, in the Start menu you will find a 
new program group where you can start <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> as well as read the included help file. 
<br>
<br>

Installing <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will also install a number of images, sprites and sound effects on your computer, all of which can be used as "place holders" to get you started making your games (but these 
are <i>not</i> for use in a final product) and there are also a number of example games installed in the form of Tutorials, as well as some more complex demo examples. All these can be found in folders within 
the location where you installed <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and can also be accessed through the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> startup window and in the IDE itself (from the 
<a href="Drop%20Down%20Menus/The%20Help%20Menu.html">Help Menu</a>).
<br>
<br>

After starting <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> for the first time, you will be shown a tutorial at the right of the main window. This tutorial will teach you how to quickly create your first game in an easy to follow 
step-by-step manner, so you can learn to use <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> as fast as possible. This tutorial can be skipped, but if you have not used <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> (nor any previous versions of 
GameMaker) before then you are strongly advised to work your way through it as it will provide an invaluable insight into how the product works. If you do skip the tutorial, you can always go back and try it 
later through the <b>Help</b> menu at the top of the main screen.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>If you have bought <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> through <b>Steam</b>, the program should install automatically, giving you the option to create a start menu icon and a desktop icon. Either 
of these can then be used to run the program on your computer, or you can run it through the <b>Steam Client</b> window library page too.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
<p>
Any computer that is less than five years old should be able to run <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> without any problems, but here are the minimum specs for your PC to use the program, and then the necessary specs for 
each of the additional modules that you may have.
<br>
<br>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<blockquote>
	<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> requires a reasonably modern PC running Windows XP, Vista, 7, or later. A DirectX 9 (or later) compatible graphics card with at <i>least</i> 32MB of memory 
	is required for most created games. It requires a screen resolution of at least 1024x768 and 65000 (16-bit) colors (but preferably 32-bit true color). Also a DirectX 9 compatible sound card, or integrated 
	sound chip, is required. It is always recommended that you make sure you have the most recent drivers installed for your system.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> requires DirectX version 9.0 or later to be installed on your computer. (You can download this version of DirectX from the Microsoft website at: 
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=35" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com</a>.) When designing and testing games, the memory requirements can 
	be pretty high (at least 128 MB and preferably more, but this depends on the operating system). When just running games, the memory requirements are less severe and depend a lot on the type of game 
	as well as the resources being used.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<i><b>NOTE:</b> Although most modern PCs ship with DirectX 10 and higher, this does not mean that DirectX 9 is present on your machine, and you should still install it from the link given above!</i>
	<br>
	<br>

	Please note that Steam users also have an additional target for compiling games which is the <b>Steam Workshop</b>. While creating and testing your game, this target module will work exactly the same 
	as the standard Windows module, however when creating your final executable you will be shown additional options to submit the game directly to Steam. More information can be found 
	<a href="Steam%20Workshop.html">here</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h4>Windows 8</h4>
<blockquote>
	All versions of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> come with the Windows 8 Native and Javascript target platforms. These targets require a Windows 8 OS to run (and for testing), and this can be the main OS or a 
	sub-os that you can dual boot with Windows 7 (or any other OS you choose to use), however you <i>cannot</i> create a final application for Windows 8 outside of that OS.
	<br>
	<br>

	You will also need to make sure that you have <b>Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5</b> installed (<b>.Net 4</b> is installed as standard with Windows 8, but you may need to install the previous version too) 
	which is available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21" target="_blank">here</a>, although when you install <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> on your Windows 8 OS it should 
	complete this part automatically.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Another thing that is necessary is a copy of <b>Microsoft Visual Studio</b> which can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>. <i>You must only 
	use VS 2012 (the express versions are fine), so even if you have a previous version of Virsual Studio, it will not work with this module.</i> A version of this product that supports Windows Store Javascript app 
	creation is essential as you will need it to create the <tt>*.pfx</tt> file which is your <b>Developer Key</b> and needed to submit your apps and games to the Windows Store.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	The <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> Windows 8 export target will create an app specifically for the Windows 8 OS, and it will be compatible with many of the unique features that this OS offers the user. However, 
	if you wish to publish this game through the Microsoft Store for Windows, you <i>must</i> have a <b>Microsoft Developers Licence</b> which is available by signing up for an account 
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229512.aspx">here</a>. There is a small cost involved in registering for this account and you will need to have a valid bank account and credit 
	facilities to be able to monetise any apps that you submit to the store.	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Further information on setting up the Windows 8 modules can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22182733" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>	
</blockquote>

<h4>Mac OSX</h4>
<blockquote>
	To use the MacOSX target module, you will need to have a Mac computer with an Intel chipset and running Lion (OSX 10.7) OS or above. You will also need to download and install Xcode for your version of the 
	OS.It's generally recommended that you use the latest OSX and the latest Xcode (you can find the version your Mac has by clicking on the "Apple" logo in the top left and selecting the "About this Mac" option 
	from the drop down menu).
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Further information on setting up the MacOSX module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22177193" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h3>Additional Modules</h3>
<p>
The above modules are included as standard for all versions of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> but the following modules are available only to those who have upgraded from the <b>Free</b> or <b>Standard</b> 
version of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to the <b>Professional</b> version (more information on the different versions of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> can be found <a href="Versions.html">here</a>).
<br>
<br>

<h4>Ubuntu (Linux)</h4>
<blockquote>
	The Linux module is designed to be compatible with the Ubuntu operating system, and although it should work with other Linux systems, it is only guaranteed to work with the latest versions of this 
	popular Linux OS.
	<br>
	<br>

	Further information on setting up the Ubuntu module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/23167703" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>
			
<h4>iOS</h4>
<blockquote>
	The <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> iOS module requires that you have a Mac computer (or at least access to one) and that it meets the minimum requirements for the <b>MacOSX</b> target module (see above)
	and <b>you must be a registered Apple developer and have all certificates and licenses up to date</b>. For more information on becoming a registered Apple Developer and how to get the necessary certificates, 
	please visit the Apple developer site <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<br>
	<br>

	Nearly all iOS devices are compatible with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> including:
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>iPhone 4G, 4Gs, 5G
			<li>iPad 1, 2 &amp; 3
			<li>iPod Touch 3rd Gen and above
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	It also doesn't matter if you are testing on an iPhone or an iPad as all iOS project builds created by GameMaker:Studio are, as standard, universal apps. This means that they will run on both iPhone 
	and iPad devices without problems.
	<br>
	<br>

	Further information on setting up the iOS module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22901986" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h4>Android</h4>
<blockquote>
	Before actually starting to work with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and Android, it is worth noting that Android devices vary immensely in capability. The GameMaker:Studio runner will only work with Android 
	2.2(Froyo) and above (2.1 may work but it's performance will not be good), which covers the majority of devices around at the moment but not all of them, so please check and make sure which version of 
	Android your device uses. It is also recommended that your device have a dedicated GPU with Open GL version 1.1 or above. Devices without a GPU will still run your GameMaker:Studio projects, but expect 
	them to have 	severe drop in performance.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	You will also need to download the <b>Android SDK</b> as <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> requires some of the components of the different Android versions and the Platform Tools it installs. You can get a 
	copy of the SDk <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">here</a>. if you are also using the YoYo Compiler (YYC) then you will also need to install a copy of the <a>Android NDK</a> which 
	can be found <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">here</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Further information on setting up the Android module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/23363366" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

			
<h4>HTML5</h4>
<blockquote>
	The HTML5 export module requires only an HTML5 compliant browser. Note that although most modern browsers are capable of running HTML5 games, not all of them support the WebGL standard currently 
	so we recommend Chrome for testing as that shows all the features supported by the module.
	<br>
	<br>
		
	Further information on setting up the HTML5 module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22899003" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h4>Windows Phone</h4>
<blockquote>
	Creating games for the Windows Phone module requires that you have installed the <b>Windows Phone SDK 8.0</b> (download from <a href="http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk" 
	target="_blank">here</a>). You will also need a Windows 8 PC with the following specifications:
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 8, running 64-bit. A 32-bit system is not supported.
			<li>4Gb RAM minimum
			<li>6.5Gb of disk space
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
	if you do not have a Windows Phone device, you can make use of the <b>Windows Phone emulator</b>, however be aware that these additional requirements will also apply in that case:
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 8 Professional or Enterprise Edition
			<li>Hardware virtualization
			<li>Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
			<li>DHCP, so the virtual machine can get a IP address on the local network
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
	<i><b>NOTE:</b> The Windows Phone SDK will also install Microsoft Visual Basic Express for Windows Phone as well, so there is no need to install it separately.</i>
	<br>
	<br>

	Further information on setting up the Windows Phone module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22446671" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h4>Tizen</h4>
<blockquote>
	The Tizen target module has certain pre-requisites that must be met before being used, the most important of these is that you must have installed the Tizen SDK (available You can get the SDK 
	<a href="https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/tizen-sdk" target="_blank">here</a>).
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<i><b>WARNING!</b>:The current Tizen SDK <b>does not work on Windows 8</b>, so you will need to have an earlier OS installed on your development machine (you can dual boot to Windows XP, 
	Vista, or 7). Also note that the 64bit SDK may not work, even if your OS is 64bit, so if in doubt you should choose the 32bit version.</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Apart from that you will also need the following:
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>dual-core 2 GHz CPU
			<li>At least 2 GB of RAM memory
			<li>At least 3 GB of free disk space
			<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle Java JDK</a> (v6 or above) installed (do <i>not</i> use OpenJDK)
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
	If you do not have access to a Tizen device, you may be able to use the <b>Tizen Emulator</b>, however you must also meet the following requirements for it to work correctly:
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>A CPU that supports Intel VTx
			<li>At least 1280 x 1024 screen resolution
			<li>The most up to date graphics drivers for OpenGL ES acceleration
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	
	Further information on setting up the Tizen module can be found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/25022406" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h4>The YoYo Compiler (YYC)</h4>
<blockquote>
	The YYC takes the normal <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> output and then compiles that into native code for the target platform, "stripping out" unneeded functions and performing a host of other optimisation 
	techniques to create a smaller and performance enhanced executable. This can increase your games performance by at least two or three times, especially on logic-heavy games, and gives an incredible overall 
	boost to performance, ideal for those larger or CPU intensive games.
	<br>
	<br>

	Although the compiler is classed as a stand-alone module, it is in reality a number of separate modules, one for each available target. So if you have, for example, the iOS and Android modules and then get 
	the YYC, you will see two new modules added to your target list - <b>iOS (YYC)</b> and <b>Android (YYC)</b>. Should you get other modules at a later date the, the YYC will update too and show an extra 
	<b>(YYC)</b> module for that target platform.

	<blockquote>
		<i><b>NOTE: </b>The YYC is not available for the HTML5 target, nor any of those that are JavaScript (JS) based.</i>
		<br>
		<br>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	The requisites for the YYC target module will depend on the original target modules that you have and wish to use it with, as they will need to be set up correctly before the YYC will work correctly. You can find 
	further information about this from the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/24468366" target="_blank"> YoYo Games Knowledge Base</a> as well as on the individual target module 
	<a href="../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/index.html">Global Game Settings</a> pages detailed in this manual.

	<blockquote>
		<i><b>NOTE: </b> Currently, the YYC is only available for <b>Windows</b>, <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> targets but future updates will add further target modules.</i>
		<br>
		<br>
