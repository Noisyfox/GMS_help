<h1>Scripts</h1>

<h2>Scripts are the way in which <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> permits you to design your own functions.</h2>

<p>
You can use code in a number of places within <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>, from objects, to rooms and instances, and there are a number of built in functions that make your life easier when programming, 
however it is often necessary for you to create your <i>own</i> functions to do a specific task, or to condense a large section of code into a more manageable chunk, or even to be able to re-use a particular 
code block in many different places. That is why <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> gives you the ability to create <b>scripts</b>.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>If you are using the <b>Free</b> version of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you are limited to a maximum of 10 scripts per game. For more details see 
<a href="../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">here</a>.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3>What Is A Script?</h3>
<p>
Scripts are written using <b>GML</b> (the <b>G</b>ame <b>M</b>aker <b>L</b>anguage, covered in the <a href="../002_Reference/index.html">Reference</a> section), which is the built-in programming 
language that <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> uses. Once you become more familiar with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and want to use it to its fullest extent, it is advisable to start learning to use this language, as it 
greatly expands your possibilities when creating games.
<br>
<br>

A script (like any built-in function) can take different input variables, with real, string, boolean and special values like <tt>all</tt> or <tt>no-one</tt> being accepted, and these input variables are generally  called 
<b>arguments</b>, although they are also referred to as <b>parameters</b>. To execute a script from an object or a time line you can use the <a href="../000_Using%20GameMaker/Actions/003_Control%20actions.html">Execute 
Script </a> action , but you can also call it in a code box using the actual script name as if it were a function or even by using the GML function <a href="../002_Reference/Miscellaneous/script_execute.html">
script_execute</a>. If you use the script action you can specify the script you want to execute, together with the up to five arguments, but if you are using the code editor to call a script, you can pass up to sixteen 
arguments.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Using Scripts</h3>
<p>
As mentioned above, you can pass a number of arguments to a script, and it will use these to perform the task you have written it for. To understand this better, take, for example, an action (or a code in GML) and think 
about how it works... you place it in an event and specify a number of parameters and it will make your instance do something. Scripts are exactly the same, with the only difference being that you write them! Not only 
can you pass arguments into a script, but you can also ask a script to <b>return</b> a value too (using the <tt>return</tt> keyword), so you can use them to build calculating methods (mathematical methods) or give 
back an instance id after a complex collision detection or any number of things. Please note, however, that using <tt>return</tt> effectively ends the script, and so <i>no code after it has been used will be executed</i>, 
and this means that a certain amount of thought has to go into how your scripts are structured.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Saving and Loading Scripts</h3>
<p>
You can save and load scripts from <tt>*.txt</tt> files into <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and in this way you can create collections of scripts and store them for use in multiple projects. To load a script (or 
a collection of scripts) into <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>, simply right-click on the scripts resource folder (or any sub-folder that you have created in that section) and select <b>Add Existing Script</b>. This 
will open the file browser and you can select either a script *.gmx, <i>or</i> a *.txt file. They will then be loaded in to <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>.
<br>
<br>

For saving scripts it's a similar process, where you right-click on a script (or a script folder) and select <b>Export Selected Script</b>. This will open up a window asking you where to export to, and when you
click on "Okay", the script will be saved as a *.txt file, with the name of the file being the same as the name of the script. If you have selected multiple scripts in a folder, they will all be saved, each with the 
name of the script they correspond to.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Creating A Script</h3>
<p>
To create a script in your game, choose <b>Create Script</b> from the <b>Resources</b> menu, or right click on the scripts resource in the resource tree and select <b>Create Script</b>, or just click the create script 
button on the toolbar at the top of the main <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> screen. Whatever method you choose will open the following window :

<img class="center"  src="../images/form_script.png">

<i><b>Note : </b>The script editor window and the code editor window for objects have exactly the same functionality. The only difference between them is that the script editor has a <b>name</b> box whereas the 
code editor has the choice of which instance is to run the code (self, other or object), just like the D'n'D actions.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3>The Script Editor</h3>
<p>
<p>
When you open the script editor, you should first give your new script a name. This should be something sensible and easy to remember and recognise, and must <i>not</i> start with a number or have any symbols (except 
the under-bar "_" symbol). The name you give the script is the one you will use later as a function in code. It is also a good idea to write some comments at the start of the script (see the above image) to outline the script 
arguments and how it should be used, especially if you are going to work as part of a team, or plan on using many scripts in your game.
<br>
<br>

Once you have done that you can start to write your script using standard GML functions and variables, using the many options along the Toolbar at the top to help you in this process. Here is a brief explanation of what each of 
the toolbar buttons does :

<img class="center"  src="../images/Script_Toolbar.png">

<blockquote>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Confirm.png"></div><br>
	<b>Confirm</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This will close the script editor and save any changes you have made. Be aware that there are no confirmation messages asking if you want to save.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Sprite_From_File.png"></div><br>
	<b>Load A Script From A File</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This will open the standard window for loading a script that has previously been saved as a text file. This will <i>replace</i> the existing script with the loaded one.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Save.png"></div><br>
	<b>Save Script</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This will save your current script as a *.txt file, ready to be used in another game. 
	<br>
	<br>	
<div style="float:left">
<img src="../images/Print.png"></div><br>
	<b>Print Script</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	 This will open a standard windows dialogue where you can select a printer and print out your current script on paper.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">	
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Undo.png"></div><br>
	<b>Undo</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This will undo the last action, and you can repeatedly undo consecutive actions with this button, but note that the number of undos that can be performed is limited to 16.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Redo.png"></div><br>
	<b>Redo</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	If you have used the undo function, you can use this to go back to the state that you undid. This is limited to the number of undos that you have done previously.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Cut.png"></div><br>
	<b>Cut</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	You can use this to "cut" a section of your code out of the script. This code is stored to the clipboard and can then be pasted into another part of the same script, another script resource or even into some 
	other program, independent of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Copy.png"></div><br>
	<b>Copy</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This button will copy the currently selected code into the clipboard for use in another place, either the same script, another script or even an alternate program.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="More%20about%20sprites/Paste.png"></div><br>
	<b>Paste</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	You can use this button to paste whatever text you have previously stored in the clipboard (with cut, or copy) into the current script.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="../images/Search.png"></div><br>
	<b>Check Syntax</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Clicking this button will open the search/find and replace tab in the script editor. See below for more details.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="../images/Debug_Script.png"></div><br>
	<b>Check Syntax</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This button will toggle on and off the syntax checker of the script editor. When on, any errors in the code syntax will be highlighted in red (default) and a message will be displayed at the bottom of the editor 
	explaining briefly what the problem is. Note that not all aspects can be tested at this stage but the syntax of your script will be tested, together with the existence of functions used.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="../images/Autocomplete.png"></div><br>
	<b>Auto Complete</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	When this is switched on, if you pause when typing something an auto-complete window will pop up and you can then use the cursor keys or mouse to navigate to the function that you are looking for. The image 
	below illustrates this :
	<br>
	<br>
		<img class="center" src="../images/AutoComplete_Image.png">
	<br>
	<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<p>
There are a number of keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate around the script editor, and each one is designed to help you get the most from this powerful tool :

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>By pressing <b>f2</b> you get  the <b>code snippet</b> pop-up, which permits you to select one of the commonly used code methods. You can define your own code snippets if you want to, as the 
	snippets are 	stored in the file <tt>snippets.txt</tt> in the folder in which GameMaker:Studio</i> is installed. You can edit this file with any text editor, and each snippet is on a separate line (there should 
	be no blank lines). It starts 	with the name of the snippet (which is what is shown in the menu) followed by the colon (:) followed by the actual snippet of code. Use # for a newline and put the text that needs 
	to be selected first between | symbols. 	See the examples that are already in the file, and it is strongly recommended that you make a backup of it before you start changing it.</li><br>

	<li>You can use <b>f7</b> and <b>f8</b> to change the size of the font within the editor.</li><br>
	
	<li>If you press <b>f10</b> you can toggle on or off the color coding for your code.</li><br>
	
	<li>Press <b>&lt;CTRL&gt; + F</b> to call up the <b>search, find and replace</b> options (see below).
	
	<li>If you are using multiple scripts, then you can press <b>f12</b> when the mouse is over any of the other script names to have it opened in a new window, ready for editing. If no script is selected, then 
	the manual will be opened.</li><br>
	
	<li>You can use <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; + Z</b> for undo and <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> + <b>&lt;Shift&gt; + Z</b> for redo.</li><br>

	<li>The <b>arrow keys</b> move you around in the text, and you can use <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> with the left and right arrow key to move to the beginning of the previous or next word. If you use 
	<b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> 	with the up and down arrows you also scroll the text.</li><br>
	
	<li>You can hold the <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b> key and move with the arrow keys to select text.</li><br>
	  
	<li>The <b>&lt;Home&gt;</b> key moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and the <b>&lt;End&gt;</b> key to the end of the line, and if you also hold <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> they move to the start 
	and end of the script. Holding the <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b> key you can select the text too.</li><br>
		
	<li>Use <b>&lt;TAB&gt;</b> to indent <i>selected</i> lines and <b>&lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;TAB&gt;</b> to unindent <i>selected</i> lines.</li><br>
	
	<li>Hold <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> with the <b>&lt;Backspace&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Delete&gt;</b> key to delete until the beginning of the previous or next word.</li><br>
		  
	<li>You can force the auto-complete window to appear if you have it switched off in the <a href="Preferences/Scripts%20Preferences.html">Scripts Preferences</a> by pressing 
	<b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Space&gt;</b>, and you can cancel it at anytime by pressing <b>&lt;ESC&gt;</b>.</li><br>
	
	<li>You can drag a selection with the mouse. (Use <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> to copy it.) The new location is immediately shown.</li><br>
			
	<li>You can scroll through the text with the mouse wheel and with <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b> pressed the cursor scrolls with the text. As with previous shortcuts, holding the <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b> key selects 
	text.</li>
	
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Adding Comments and Naming Code Blocks</h3>
<p>
Commenting your code is very important for maintaining productivity as it keeps things clear and separates sections of code in such a way that it is obvious what each part does and why it is there. It also means that if 
you are working in a team then you can leave notes for other members and that they will know exactly what you have done or what a specific section of code is for. Even if you are a solo developer, leaving comments 
for your code is important, especially if you have to leave the project and come back to it at a later date.
<br>
<br>

Commenting your code is simple, as you just have to use "<tt>//</tt>" before any line of text or you can comment out whole paragraphs by using "<tt>/* text here */</tt>". The following image illustrates a 
script using both these methods:

<img class="center" src="../images/Form_CodeComments.png">

If you are in the <b>code</b> editor, then you can also give your code box a title by making a comment for the first line using the following format:
<br>
<br>
	<p class="code">
	///Your Comment Here!
	</p>
<p>
<br>
This comment will then be used for the "name" of that codebox (this works for codeboxes added to <a href="005_Time%20lines.html">Timelines</a> too) as illustrated by the following image:

<img class="center" src="../images/Form_CodeboxName.png">

	
<h3>Color coding</h3>
<p>
As you might have noticed, parts of the script text are colored. The script editor "knows" about existing objects, built-in variables and functions, etc. and color codes them accordingly. Color-coding helps a lot in avoiding mistakes, 
in particular, you see immediately if you have misspelled some name or use a keyword as a variable, or have a syntax error. However, if you don't like the color coding, in the <a href="../001_Advanced%20Use/Preferences/index.html">
Preferences</a> you can switch it on and off (you can also use <b>F10</b>) as well as customise the colors that are used.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Search, Find And Replace</h3>
<p>
When working with code, it is common that you will want to find some piece you have written in a large section and then replace it something different, or simply see at a glance where a line of code lies within the function. To this 
end, the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> script editor has a search, find and replace function that can be accessed by pressing the Search button in the toolbar. This will open up a panel on the right of the code window which looks as 
follows :

<img class="center" src="../images/form_script2.png">

You can type the find string at the top (note that in the code all occurrences of the find string are immediately shown with a yellow background), and you can indicate whether the search must be case sensitive, which is normally 
what you want as variable and function names in GML are also case sensitive, and whether you want to only search for whole words. Note that the editor remembers your most recent searches, and you can click on the drop down 
button to call them up and re-select them. With the buttons underneath the search string input you can now move to the previous, next, first, and last occurrence of the find string, and this string will be selected in the text so that 
you can edit it.
<br>
<br>

You can also use this panel to replace  anything that you have previously searched for by simply typing in the new code that is to be used and pressing one of the buttons that are highlighted underneath. 
x. Now you can use the buttons to replace the previously selected, the next one to be selected, the first, the last or all occurrences of the code searched for.
